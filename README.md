# FetchFPLAPI
A NodeJS implementation of FPL API fetch to list all players of a team

https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/

Further plan is to extend the script to take two inputs - position (`element_type`)
and team to print all the players that play in a particular position for a team and
all the statistics for each of them.

Also, plan is to add 2 more inputs that take a particular stat name and stat threshold
and returns a further filtered list for all players that have a value for a stat that is
greater than the threshold.
